Homework-04 Timed Quiz on JavaScript Fundamentals

## Description

This is a timed quiz used to demonstrate DOM manipulation. You have 75 seconds to answer all 8 questions. Incorrect answers subtract 15 seconds from your time, and any time left when you're done is the score you get. 

I accomplished this through by looping through an array of question objects and updating the values on buttons and header tags through DOM manipulation. This assignment has really helped me to understand the way JavaScript can be used to make pages interactive -- and also helps me appreciate how JQuery makes things even easier.
